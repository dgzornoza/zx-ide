- Create and open a new project with z88dk
- Put breakpoints in c or asm source files (breackpoints are mappet to debug lis file)
- Press F5 or select play button in debug panel to start debugging

Refers to [Wiki](https://github.com/dgzornoza/zx-ide/wiki) for more information.

> **Remarks:** *Adding or removing breakpoints should always be done in the source code file, this will create or remove a breakpoint in the .lis file that will be used in debugging.*

## Clean containers

To remove containers that have not been used in a while and free up memory, you can run the following command:

```bash
# (168h = 7 days)
docker container prune --filter "until=168h"
```
